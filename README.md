# Year-1-intro-to-AI-1st-Coursework

The task is to design and implement the knowledge base for an AIML-based chatbot that is able to correctly answer all of the questions using an expert system architecture. Working on this assignment will help me gain experience of creating intelligent solutions that embed user knowledge in a human-readable rule-based form. The chosen language is AIML and to produce a concise scaleable solution that explicitly separates different types of knowledge. 

The use of the [Pandorabots website](https://home.pandorabots.com/home.html) online  bot-hosting systems has helped to develop and refine the bot.
